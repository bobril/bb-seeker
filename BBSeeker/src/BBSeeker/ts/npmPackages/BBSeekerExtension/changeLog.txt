==============
version 2.1.11
==============
- fixed: Space and Enter keypress now fires also click event upon native button element as browser would do.

=============
version 2.1.2
=============
- fixed spell syntax mistakes
- fixed incorrectly inserted two enters instead of one in text area on ENTER key press action
- fixed - clicking on specific element now clicks on the topmost element 
(if the specified element (or its inner coordinates if specified) is overlapped by another element then click is emitted on the topmost element)
- for click on specific element actions added possibility to specific element inner coordinates (within element) to click on ( by default is upper left corner point on 1x1 inner coordinates)    
- added support for scrolling (on specific element or on coordinates):
     - vertically ( by wheel button, by px step or to exact vertical position)
     - horizontally ( by px step or to exact vertical position)
- added support for virtual cursor move action (triggers bobril pointer/mouse move, mouseOver, mouseEnter, mouseLeave, mouseOut, mouseIn handlers)
    (it is just move of virtual cursor (on bobril lvl) => it is not possible to move with physical cursor by JS => CSS hover style will not be applied)
- added automatic scrolling to the element or coordinates which should be clicked or cursor move to if the element (coordinates) is out of the viewport. 
- types and global interface relocated to separated module
